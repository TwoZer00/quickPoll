1. Overview

Quickpoll ("we", "our", or "us") provides a platform that allows users to create and participate in surveys that are available for 30 minutes. After the survey closes, all results are made public.
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any information that may be collected when you use our service.

2. Information We Collect

We minimize data collection and only use information necessary to provide our services.
When you use Quickpoll:

We use Firebase for authentication, analytics, and data storage.

We use anonymous sign-up, so we do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or contact details.

Firebase automatically collects some technical data (such as device type, operating system, and usage events) to help us maintain and improve the app.

3. How We Use Information

We use collected data to:

Operate and maintain the survey platform.

Prevent spam or abuse.

Analyze app performance and usage patterns (in aggregated form).

We do not sell, rent, or trade your information to any third parties.

4. Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase infrastructure.
We rely on Firebaseâ€™s built-in security and encryption to protect survey data.
Survey responses are retained only as long as necessary for the service to function, and the results are made public after each survey closes.

5. Public Data

Please note that all survey results are public once a survey ends.
Do not include personal or sensitive information in your survey responses if you do not wish it to be shared.

6. Third-Party Services

Our app uses Firebase, a service provided by Google LLC.

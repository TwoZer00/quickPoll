By accessing or using Quickpoll, you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

2. Description of Service

Quickpoll allows users to:

Create and participate in short surveys.

Access public survey results after each survey closes.

Each survey remains open for 30 minutes and is then automatically closed and published publicly.

3. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

Use the app only for lawful purposes.

Not post, share, or request personal or sensitive information in surveys.

Not attempt to disrupt or misuse the service or its infrastructure.

You are responsible for the content you create through the app.

4. Anonymous Usage

We use anonymous sign-up through Firebase.
You will not be personally identified unless you voluntarily share information within survey content (which we strongly advise against).

5. Public Content

After a survey closes, all responses and results become publicly accessible.
You understand and agree that once published, your responses cannot be removed or made private.

6. Service Availability

We strive to keep the service running smoothly, but we do not guarantee continuous or error-free operation.
We may suspend, modify, or discontinue the app at any time without notice.

7. Intellectual Property

All code, design, and functionality of Quickpoll are owned by TwoZer00.
Users retain ownership of their survey content but grant us a license to host and display it publicly as part of the service.

8. Limitation of Liability

Quickpoll is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
We are not liable for any damages resulting from use or inability to use the app, including data loss or exposure of survey responses.

9. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time.
Continued use of the app after changes are posted means you accept the updated Terms.
